Abstract:
Consciousness has traditionally been treated either as an independent entity or an emergent property of the brain. This paper presents the Soni Process Model of Consciousness (SPMC), a naturalistic, process-based framework in which consciousness is neither born nor externally introduced. Consciousness arises as a name for the dynamic process of matter-energy interactions, signal generation, and subsequent experience. The model aligns with neuroscience, biochemistry, and physics, offering a testable framework without invoking metaphysical assumptions.
Keywords: Consciousness, Process Model, Experience, Matter-Energy, Signal, Naturalistic Philosophy
1. Introduction
Consciousness remains one of the most profound questions in science and philosophy. Traditional approaches either describe consciousness as a metaphysical entity or as an emergent property of neural activity. However, these perspectives leave critical questions unresolved:
How does experience arise from matter and energy?
Can consciousness exist without invoking metaphysical constructs?
The Soni Process Model of Consciousness (SPMC) addresses these questions by establishing consciousness as a natural, process-based phenomenon:
It is not a separate entity.
It does not enter externally.
It is the processual manifestation of experience generated from matter-energy interactions.
2. Theoretical Framework
2.1 Core Hypothesis
Consciousness emerges from matter-energy interactions, mediated by signals within living systems:
Where:
� = Consciousness
� = Experience
� = Signals
� = Matter and Energy
2.2 Components
Component
Description
Matter (M)
Biological structures, chemical compounds, neural tissues
Energy (E)
Chemical, electrical, thermal energy driving transformations
Action-Reaction (AR)
Interaction of matter mediated by energy changes
Signal (S)
Electrical or chemical signals in living systems
Experience (Ex)
Subjective manifestation of signals in the perceiving system
Operational Definition:
Consciousness = Experience generated by signals from matter-energy interactions

Notes:
Signals alone are necessary but not sufficient.
Consciousness is process-dependent, not entity-dependent.
4. Illustrative Example
A fragrant flower emits volatile molecules (M, E interactions).
Olfactory receptors generate neural signals (S).
The brain forms the experience of scent (Ex).
The scent exists not in the flower, but as experience in the perceiver, validating that consciousness is a process of perceiving signals.
5. Scientific Consistency
SPMC aligns with:
Neuroscience: Neural correlates of perception
Biochemistry: Signal transduction mechanisms
Physics: Energy conservation and interactions
Cognitive Science: Experience as emergent from dynamic interactions
No metaphysical assumption is invoked; consciousness is naturalistic and testable.
6. Significance
Process-based perspective avoids reification of consciousness.
Differences in internal energy states can predict variations in experience.
Provides philosophical clarity by eliminating “soul” or dualism.
Practical applications: AI, neuroscience, cognitive modeling.
7. Conclusion
Consciousness is neither born nor externally introduced; it is the dynamic process of matter-energy interactions and experience generation.
This model provides a rigorous, testable, and globally applicable framework, suitable for scientific and philosophical inquiry.

Subject: Submission of Manuscript – Soni Process Model of Consciousness (SPMC)
Dear Editor,
I am pleased to submit my manuscript entitled “Soni Process Model of Consciousness (SPMC): A Process-Based Scientific Framework” for consideration in Frontiers in Psychology – Cognition.
This manuscript presents a novel, testable, naturalistic framework for consciousness, demonstrating that consciousness is a process arising from matter-energy interactions and resultant experience, without invoking metaphysical assumptions. The model is fully consistent with empirical neuroscience, biochemistry, and physics, offering both scientific rigor and philosophical clarity.
I confirm that this manuscript has not been published previously and is not under consideration elsewhere.
Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to your positive response.
Sincerely,
Sanjay Soni
